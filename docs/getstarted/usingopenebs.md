## Community edition vs enterprise edition

Currently, the main difference betwen the two editions is rugged testing of the enterprise code and the support from MayaData through MayaData OpenEBS Enterprise Platform.  If you are already using OpenEBS community edition in production or in test and want support, start by signing up at [MayaData](https://account.mayadata.io) and connecting your cluster to OpenEBS director.



More details about OpenEBS Enterprise Edition is already provided [here](/docs/product/overview#openebs-enterprise-edition). 

## Join community

OpenEBS community is very vibrant with many active users willing to help you get started. If you are not a part of the community, you may want to join the community slack
