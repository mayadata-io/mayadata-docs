Users requiring access to OpenEBS Enterprise Platform need to create an account at MayaData. 



If you have not already signed up for an account, begin by creating one.



## Sign-Up



Visit [Sign Up](https://account.mayadatastaging.io/signup) page for creating an account.

Sign-up can be done in three methods.

- Using an email address and password
- Using Goolge Single Sign-On
- Using GitHub Single Sign-On



> Note: If you have created an account at app.mayaonline.io earlier using GitHub Single Sign-On, you are automatically migrated to an account at MayaData. You can Sign-In into MayaData using GitHub SSO.

## Email verification

All communication with you will be done using your email address. Having a completed user profile with us is mandatory for enabling all features.

After you sign-up for an account, you are required to complete your profile and verify your email. If your email address is not provided by GitHub or is different than what is provided by GitHub, provide your email address in the user portal and verify it.

## Benefits of having an account

When you complete the user profile and verify your email address, you get access to the following

- Access to support portal where you gain access to knowledge base articles, community forums, support tickets and chatting with our support agents.
- A free subscription to OpenEBS Director Online, and 
- Free access to OpenEBS Director Onprem

## Multiple accounts

While signing up, you can sign up using any of the three choices (Email, Google or GitHub). If you sign up with more than one choice, they are treated as separate accounts. Linking of various modes of accounts may be possible in future. However, we suggest you to choose only one mode of signing up.

> If you have Kubernetes clusters connected to Director Online using a particular account and want to move them to another account of your, you have to disconnect them from one account and re-connect them in others. Note that, you will lose the metrics and logs that are stored in your original account.

## Teaming with other accounts

Teaming feature in OpenEBS Director is in the short term roadmap. Currently, all accounts are independent. 

## Account cancellation or deletion

If you have issues related to your account, see [account troubleshooting](/docs/product/userguides/common/acctroubleshoot).

To request cancellation or deletion of your account, email us at support@mayadata.io or submit a ticket at the support portal.
