The primary benefit of MayaData OpenEBS Enterprise Platform is the ability to deploy multi-cloud stateful applications using Container Attached Storage and manage them or visualize them from a single pane of glass. 

The single pane of glass or the web portal to manage the view and manage data operations is called Director. You can use Director in two modes- either as a SaaS platform at https://director.mayadata.io or as an On-Premise installation in your own private network. 



## Director as a SaaS platform 

> Requires secure network access to your Kubernetes clusters. 

Kubernetes clusters are connected to SaaS platform.

## Director as an On-Premise deployment

> Director operates in a secure private network on a cloud or in an air-gapped environment.
