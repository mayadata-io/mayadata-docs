OpenEBS, Litmus and Director can be installed separately, however the subscriptions or licenses are based on the platform and not on the components. 



### OpenEBS Enterprise Edition

OpenEBS community edition and enterprise edition share the same code base. Enterprise edition undergoes rigourous testing at MayaData. The CI pipelines for enterprise edition includes additional scenarios like workload tuning, scalability and performance. Hot patches are provided to customers when required which are eventually merged into upstream code base.



Community users can connect their Kubernetes clusters to Director Online or Director Onprem by signing up at MayaData to get free visibility of OpenEBS components. Director software will upgrade OpenEBS control plane and volume software where applicable and necessary.

### Director

OpenEBS Director written as a Kubernetes application is available in two modes - as a SaaS platform (Director Online at https://director.mayadata.io) and as a Onprem version (Director Onprem). In both these modes, users connect their Kubernetes clusters to get deep visibility into the functionig of OpenEBS and some additional built-in services. 

When a Kubernetes cluster is connected to Director, a set of agents are installed in a separate namespace (called `maya-system` or `maya-onprem`). The agents consume certain amount of resources in terms of CPU and memory depending on the size of cluster. With additional configuration, Director can also be used for monitoring and log management of all the Kubernetes applications apart from those using OpenEBS as storage. 

Accessing Director Online: A free subscription is created when you sign up at MayaData. Access Director at https://director.mayadata.io. More details for getting started with Director Online, see the user guide here.

Director Onprem is accessible as a download from the user portal at https://accounts.mayadata.io. After requesting access to Director Onprem, instructions will be emailed to the user. User guide for Director Onprem is here.
